In this capstone project, we explore the usages of Reinforcement Learning for constructing a financial portfolio and for the enhancement of quantitative investment strategies (QIS). In particular, we explore the usage of Policy Gradient Methods (PGM) due to their ability to handle continuous action spaces. PGM are used to create a model-free agent that selects portfolio weights for a portfolio of QIS. The PGM which our group explored are: REINFORCE, REINFORCE with Baseline, Actor-Critic, and Actor-Critic with Eligibility Traces.
