**Abstract**<br/>

In this capstone we explored the usage of Reinforcement Learning for portfolio construction and enhancement of quantitative investment strategies (QIS). Particularly we explored the usage of  Policy Gradient Methods (PGM) due to their ability to handle continuous action spaces. We used PG to create a model free agent that selects portfolio weights for a portfolio of QIS. The PGM explored are: REINFORCE, REINFORCE with baseline, Actor-Critic, Actor-Critic with eligibility traces and soft-actor Critic.
