In this capstone project, we explored the usages of Reinforcement Learning for portfolio construction and the enhancement of quantitative investment strategies (QIS). In particular, we explored the usage of Policy Gradient Methods (PGM) due to their ability to handle continuous action spaces. We used PGM to create a model-free agent that selects portfolio weights for a portfolio of QIS. The PGM which our group explored are: REINFORCE, REINFORCE with Baseline, Actor-Critic, Actor-Critic with Eligibility Traces, and Soft-Actor Critic.
